									<h1>Come on in! Welcome to Regina's Humble Music Abode.</h1>
									
									<p>Hello, I am Regina, a Computer Science and Cognitive Science Double Major at the University of Virginia. <br />
                                        I love to work out and spend time outside, but I definitely enjoy spending a day in to relax, watch videos, and listen to music.</p>

                                </header>
                                        <p>My music preferences have definitely come along the way! In middle school, I loved alternative music like The Cab. Going into college, I started getting more into hip hop, which was different, but fun. Today, I really enjoy a blend of hip hop and R&B! Artists that I appreciate are Daniel Caesar, dvsn, and Xavier Omar. Having previously taken two music classes at Uva, I learned a lot about the effort, technologies, and techniques of what went into the music I listen to, and I appreciate music and composition so much more now!</p>
